## Note
- Each of you shall be working in a separate router file under the folder src/routers
- Depending on the requirements of the game, think whether you need a separate model for the game and accordingly add one under the folder src/models
- Each of you shall work in a separate model
- After you start making your router, make sure that you configure that router in src/app.js by adding app.use(router_name)
- Code for various algorithms like participant matching should be kept in src/routers in a separate file
- Environment variables can be set in config/dev.env
- Whenever there is a change in package.json, you have to install new node_modules using :
```
npm install
```
- We will use ejs for dynamic rendering of content. If you are not familiar with it, learn it from <https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs>


## Contributing [Important]
- Make sure that you don't push code with bugs
- Before making any commit pull the changes from the head repository
- Don't make changes in portion assigned to other person without informing him
- Make meaningful commits
- Avoid using upload files, use the Command line for git
- Avoid pushing unnecessary files like your IDE files. Make use of .gitignore . Currently vscode and webstorm ide files are only removed from git vcs.
